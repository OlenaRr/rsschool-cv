## Summary 
<p>Currently working as a radiologist in a hospital, I wanted to explore other professions which could potentially improve my level of life and bring more benefits for the amount of work I do. Programming happens to be possibly the best option to achieve that, so I started taking courses and dived in self-learning on the topic. So far, I have fully completed a course on FreeCodeCamp (Responsive Web Design), started the next part about JavaScript, also currently undertaking a course at Rolling Scopes School (JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0) and plan on taking the following courses there as well.</p>
<p>I believe that with my level of commitment, interest and being a hard-worker, I can achieve substantial results in my learning and proceed with working in the industry.</p>

	if (d >= 0) {
		let x1 = ((-b) + Math.sqrt(d)) / (2 * a)
		let x2 = ((-b) - Math.sqrt(d)) / (2 * a)
		console.log(`X1 = ${x1} and X2 = ${x2}`)
